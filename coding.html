				<p>This game was created using object-oriented Java Programming. My partner and I completed it in Penn's Intro to Computer Programming class.</p>
				<p>You can download the game by clicking <a href="World.jar">here</a> and running the downloaded "World.jar" file. Your browser may say the file might harm your computer but I can assure you it only contains the necessary Java files for running the Donkey Kong game.</p>
				<p>The source code (with ReadMe) for the game is listed on <a href="https://github.com/maxbgrove/donkeykong-cis110" target="_blank">Github.</a></p>
				<p class="title">HTML and CSS</p>
				<p>This website was created to showcase my self-taught knowledge of HTML and CSS. The source code can be obtained by right-clicking anywhere on the background and selecting 'Show Page Source.' or navigating to the code on <a href="https://github.com/maxbgrove/maxbgrove.github.io" target="_blank">Github.</a> It was created from nothing and took 6 versions to be built into the site it is today.</p>
				<p>The 'Schooling' icon at the top of the page was taken from Apple, Inc. All other images and icons are free use or designed by me.</p>
