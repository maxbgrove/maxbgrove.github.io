			<h6>Professional and Work Experience</h6>
			<p class="title">Speaker Pro Tempore: Undergraduate Assembly, University of Pennsylvania</p>
			<p>I serve on the Student Life Committee, where I lobby administrators for improved student life, dining hall improvements, and clearer descriptions of student fees.</p>
			<p>My freshman year, I sat on the budget Committee and allocated $2.3 million to the various student groups on campus through vetting requests to balance the budget. I now sit on the Assembly's Cabinet as Speaker Pro Tempore (internal vice president).</p>
			<p class="title">Administrative Assistant: University of Pennsylvania</p>
			<p>In this position, I was required to manage an office serving over 500 freshman. I designed flyers weekly, maintained Resident Assitant spending forms and reciepts, and supervised numerous events and dinners with professionals.</p>
			<p class="title">American Enterprise Institute</p>
			<p>With five other students, I host lectures, private dinners, discussions, and events promoting conversation on public policy with professionals in the field. We serve to promote the exchange of ideas and open people's minds to viewpoints they may not have thought of before.</p>
			<p class="title">Food Service Mentor: Woodcrest Villa</p>
			<p>At Woodcrest Villa, I served and was cross-trained in every aspect of dining services including waiter, host, baker, short-order cook, and barista. I helped implement more efficient closting procedures and have experience giving exceptional dining service to over 75 people at a time.</p>
			<p class="title">Lodge Chief: Boy Scouts of America</p>
			<p>As Youth President of the Lancaster-Lebanon Council of the Boy Scouts of America, I sat on the Council Executive Board to weigh in and provide the youth perspective.</p>
			<p>I designed weekend retreats for our council's honor society and presented national level training seminars on setting goals, effective communications, and leading successful activities.</p>
